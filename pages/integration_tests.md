# Integration Tests

For integration testing an exported collection of Postman API tests are provided under ```src/test/resources/sensingdevice-integration-tests.postman_collection.json```. 

Start the server and run: 

```newman run src/test/resources/sensingdevice-integration-tests.postman_collection.json```

Or alternatively you can import the test collection into Postman and run the tests using Postman UI.
